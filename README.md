# Statues! & more!

This is just a legacy repository to keep track of a project I was very proud of as a kid (I was 15, back in 2012, when I created this thing...).

This was a Minecraft mod adding [statues](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1283442-1-4-2-rewritten-statues-more-v4pre-alpha)... & more. It was quite popular at the time and a similar functionality was added later in the core game.

At that time I didn't even know what a VCS was, so I didn't have any repository to track my code... Just a bunch of directories, one per version. So each commit on this repository represents one of these directories, a version of the project, be indulgent, I was very bad at coding at this time ("What? I'm still bad at coding nowadays?"), and my english was even worse than today, as you will see by reading code comments or [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Unfortunately I don't have any screenshot of the mod, because these screenshots were uploaded on shitty image uploaders who deleted them a long time ago.
